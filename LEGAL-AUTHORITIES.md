# Legal authorities (case law, statutes, rules)

This site mirrors a local copy of California case law materials, statutory extracts, and court rules used in briefing and analysis. **Prefer the PDF** when both a reporter-style PDF and a Markdown extract exist; use **Markdown** when no PDF is present or for quick reading; use **external** (Justia, leginfo, courts.ca.gov) when the authority is cited on the site but not yet cached locally.

**Master index:** [CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/INDEX.md](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/INDEX.md) (tables of cases, statutes, opinion PDFs, and coverage reports).

## Folder layout (under `CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/`)

| Folder | Contents |
|--------|----------|
| [opinions-pdf/](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/opinions-pdf/) | Opinion PDFs (including Demurrer / motion-strike / equity batches). Some entries include paired `.md` / `.raw.txt` extractions. |
| [cases-cal-supreme/](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/cases-cal-supreme/) | California Supreme Court: narrative `.md` (often with source URLs in the file). |
| [cases-cal-appellate/](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/cases-cal-appellate/) | Court of Appeal: narrative `.md`. |
| [statutes-cal/](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/statutes-cal/) | Code sections pulled from [leginfo.legislature.ca.gov](https://leginfo.legislature.ca.gov) (source URL in each file). |
| [standards/](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/standards/) | California Rules of Court excerpts (e.g. CRC 8.204). |
| [rules-of-court/](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/rules-of-court/) | Statewide CRC PDFs, SF local rules (PDF + MD where applicable). |
| [DEFENSE-PLEADINGS-COVERAGE-REPORT.md](CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/DEFENSE-PLEADINGS-COVERAGE-REPORT.md) | Machine inventory vs. pleading citations (defense packet). |

**Not mirrored here:** the `scripts/` directory from the main repo (fetch / validation utilities) is omitted from this published tree; scripts remain in the repository under `CASE-LAW-AND-STATUTES/scripts/` for maintainers.

## GitHub / size

- The mirror is large (~multi‑GB) because it includes full opinion PDFs. The largest single file checked in this worktree is under **100 MB** (GitHub’s hard per-file limit is 100 MB for normal git; use **Git LFS** only if a future PDF exceeds that).

## Gaps and external fallbacks

Authorities cited on [README.md](README.md), [MERITS.md](MERITS.md), or [EXTRINSIC-FRAUD-THREADING-THE-NEEDLE-801-AND-802.md](EXTRINSIC-FRAUD-THREADING-THE-NEEDLE-801-AND-802.md) that **may not** have a local PDF in `opinions-pdf/` include (non-exhaustive):
